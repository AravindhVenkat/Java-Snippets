# Java-Snippets

Used Scanner object to get input from console.

These files in package com.demo contain basic methods with Math functions and logic 
1) SumOfCubesOfDigits.java - If input = 23 -> 2^3 + 3^3 = 8+27 = 35
2) PowerOfTwo.java - Checks if a number is a power of 2 by using Logarithmic method
3) FibonacciNumber.java - Finds the Nth term of the Fibonacci Series


These com.demo files are checked(returns boolean) whether they are in ascending order(by using ASCII).
AlphabeticalString - Converting input String into a Char array, "abc" = +num and "bac" = -num
CheckIfIncreasingNumber - Used the functionality of Ternary Operator
logic - each digit is checked in a file, if it is the last digit(one's digit, exited from loop) then divided by 10 to get every digit


These files in com.array.demo uses Array functionalities like .sort and fetched using index, eg- arr[1] = second smallest element
RemoveDuplicates.java 
SecondSmallest.java 
SortStrings.java
